# Gouraud-Shading-and-Phong-Shading #

In this project I implemented Gouraud Shading and Phong Shading on Phong Reflection Model.

Before talking about Gouraud Shading and Phong Shading,we need to know the reflection model first.The "standard" reflection model in computer graphics that compromises between acceptable results and processing cost is the Phong model. The Phong model describes the interaction of light with a surface, in terms of the properties of the surface and the nature of the incident light. The reflection model is the basic factor in the look of a three dimensional shaded object. It enables a two dimensional screen projection of an object to look real. The Phong model reflected light in terms of a diffuse and specular component together with an ambient term. The intensity of a point on a surface is taken to be the linear combination of these three components.
